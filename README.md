## üåê About HandRecognition
HandRecognition is a specialized software application that leverages advanced machine learning techniques
to recognize and interpret handwritten letters. This project combines deep learning models with 
image processing technologies to convert handwritten text into digital format accurately.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
**TensorFlow and Keras:** 
These powerful libraries provide the backbone for building and training the deep learning model. 
Leveraging TensorFlow's comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools and libraries and Keras' high-level 
neural networks API, the application achieves robust and efficient machine learning workflows.

**Python:** 
The entire application is written in Python, making it portable and easy to integrate with other technologies.
Python's simplicity and versatility make it ideal for machine learning projects, 
offering a wide range of libraries and community support.

**OpenCV and Matplotlib:** 
Used for image processing and visualization, respectively. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 
is utilized for advanced image processing techniques, essential in preparing data for the neural network. 
Matplotlib, a plotting library for Python, is used for visualizing data and results, 
enhancing the application's ability to handle and display image data effectively.

## üé• Quick Demo

- **Test Pre-Trained Model Accuracy:**
   - Run the automated letter recognition script to evaluate the model's accuracy
   ```bash
   py .\modelWords\letterScript.py
The script displays a series of images with different handwritten letters. 
After you exit each image, the program will output the recognized letter.
---
- **Test with Custom Handwritten Data**
  - To evaluate the model with your own handwritten letters and numbers, 
     specify a directory containing your images in the ManualLetterScript file
  - Execute the following command to start the recognition process:
     ```bash
     py .\modelWords\ManualLetterScript.py
  - This will process the images from your specified directory and print out the recognized characters,
   demonstrating the program's capability to handle both letters and numbers.
